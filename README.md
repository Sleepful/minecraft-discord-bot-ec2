# Discord bot to start an EC2 Server instance

This app uses a Discord bot to create `/slash` commands in the Discord channel which can be used to `start` a stopped EC2 instance. It outputs the instance state as well as the instance IPv4 address.

This was made in conjunction with the [NixOS Minecraft Server](https://github.com/Sleepful/nixos-minecraft-server-blogpost/tree/main) project but it could be useful with any EC2 instance.

This project is covered in the blogpost [Discord bot for our Minecraft server, Part 1](https://bloggeroo.dev/articles/202403051905)
